# Care Plan — crisis line verification record

> **DRAFT — requires clinical sign-off by the owner before any real-patient use.**
>
> This is a record of what the repository already asserts about four public telephone numbers, and
> of what it does **not** assert. It is not clinical authority, it is not itself a verification, and
> nothing in it approves the Care Plan prototype for use with a patient. **No number was dialled or
> checked online while this document was written** — there was no network access in that session.

**Status:** first draft, 2026-09-04. Unreviewed.
**Subject:** every telephone number printed by the Care Plan prototype's fixtures. As of the
2026-09-25 WA safety fixes, the array itself is defined once in
`src/lib/crisis-contacts.ts` (`WA_CRISIS_CONTACTS`) and re-exported unchanged as
`publicCrisisContacts` from `src/components/care-plan/mockups/fixtures.ts`, so every consumer
listed in this document still reads the same values under the same name. Three more real
numbers (Lifeline, Suicide Call Back Service, 13YARN) were added there in that change; this
record still covers only the original four.
**No number in this document has been changed.** This record was written alongside a
verification-record comment in the fixture; the values themselves are untouched.

## Why this record exists

The 2026-09-02 repository audit
([`docs/audit/full-repository-audit-2026-09-02.md`](../audit/full-repository-audit-2026-09-02.md))
recorded that the four real public crisis numbers carry a `verifiedOn` date of `2026-08-20` and a
comment saying to correct them if they have changed, but that **nothing ages that date** — no test,
no gate and no ledger row — while the same file models its synthetic community-team contacts as
`review_due` after a few months. These numbers render on the printed Personal Safety Plan and on the
Patient Plan, which are sheets a person is meant to take home.

The audit's own skeptic note is worth repeating, because it sets the size of the problem honestly:
the prototype is developer-gated synthetic data behind the production mockup block, so nobody takes
this sheet home today. The risk materialises if these fixtures are copied into a production screen.

## The four real public numbers

Every source URL below is already present in this repository. Nothing was looked up to write this.

The safety-plan-prose line references this table used to carry (`patient-safety-plan.tsx:787`,
`:818`, `:847`, `:876`) were already stale before this update — that file has grown well past
those line numbers since 2026-09-04 from unrelated work. As of 2026-09-25 the prose no longer
hand-types any of these numbers at all: it reads them from `WA_CRISIS_CONTACTS` by id (see
`patient-safety-plan.tsx`'s `crisisContact()` helper and the `EMERGENCY_CONTACT` /
`MHERL_METRO_CONTACT` / `MHERL_PEEL_CONTACT` / `RURALLINK_CONTACT` constants near the top of the
file), so no further line-number chase is needed there — the identity guarantee in
`tests/crisis-contacts.test.ts` (`publicCrisisContacts` is `WA_CRISIS_CONTACTS` itself) covers it.

### What is verified, and by what

- **The values are pinned.** `tests/care-plan-domain.test.ts:414` asserts the exact seven names,
  numbers and emergency-service flags (the four covered by this record, plus Lifeline, Suicide
  Call Back Service and 13YARN added 2026-09-25), and `:443-452` asserts that every entry carries
  an `https://` source URL, the correct `verifiedOn` for its cohort, and — for both MHERL
  entries — a caveat matching "not an emergency service".
- **The after-hours pathway must stay real.** `tests/care-plan-domain.test.ts:498` fails if any
  of the three WA numbers disappears from the fixtures, so a later change cannot quietly swap a
  working crisis line for a dead fictional one. The reasoning is `docs/care-plan/sdd-ledger.md:634`:
  the after-hours pathway prints on the patient-facing safety plan under "who to call at 2am", so a
  reader who dials it must reach a real service.
- **There is one source of truth, now one level deeper.** `src/lib/crisis-contacts.ts` defines
  `WA_CRISIS_CONTACTS` once; `src/components/care-plan/mockups/fixtures.ts` re-exports it
  unchanged as `publicCrisisContacts` (`export { WA_CRISIS_CONTACTS as publicCrisisContacts }`,
  an identity re-export, not a copy — pinned by `tests/crisis-contacts.test.ts`'s
  `toBe(WA_CRISIS_CONTACTS)` assertion), and both
  `src/components/care-plan/mockups/patient-plan-fixtures.ts:68` and
  `src/components/patient-safety-plan.tsx` read from that same re-export, so a correction in
  `crisis-contacts.ts` reaches every printed surface without retyping anything.

### What is NOT verified

- **Nothing ages `verifiedOn`.** No test, script, gate or ledger row fails when the date goes stale.
  The date is asserted to be exactly `2026-08-20`, which means the pin will have to be updated by
  hand as part of any re-verification — the assertion is a change-detector, not a currency check.
- **The numbers were not checked against their sources while writing this document.** To verify — no
  network access in this session. Every statement above is about what the repository records, not
  about what WA Health currently publishes.
- **Availability windows were not checked either.** Rurallink's stated hours ("4:30 pm to 8:30 am on
  weeknights, and 24 hours on weekends and public holidays", `fixtures.ts:292`) and the 24-hour
  MHERL claims carry the same 2026-08-20 provenance and the same absence of any ageing check.

## Re-verification cadence

**Every six months, from the `verifiedOn` date recorded in the fixture.**

| Last verified | Next due       | Owner        |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| 2026-08-20    | **2027-02-20** | Josh (owner) |

**Six months is the canonical re-verification cadence across the repository, reconciling and
superseding the 2026-09-02 audit finding L4 (which had proposed 12 months).** Two things bear on the
choice and are worth stating plainly:

- The repository's review-interval constant `REVIEW_INTERVAL_MONTHS = 12`
  (`src/components/care-plan/mockups/types.ts:88`) governs **care-plan reviews, not contact
  numbers**. The prototype's `verificationState` for its synthetic community teams is a stored
  fixture value, not a value derived from any threshold, so it is not a precedent either.
- The 2026-09-02 audit's own fix sketch (finding L4) initially proposed twelve months ("fails loudly on 2027-08-20").

Six months is the more conservative of the two, which is appropriate for numbers dialled in crisis
at 3am. The 6-month re-verification cadence is now canonical across all care-plan and caring-contacts
surfaces.

### The procedure

1. Open each source URL in the table above.
2. Confirm the number, the coverage area, and the availability window still match what
   `WA_CRISIS_CONTACTS` holds (`src/lib/crisis-contacts.ts`).
3. **If a value has changed, correct it in `src/lib/crisis-contacts.ts` and nowhere else.**
   `fixtures.ts` only re-exports the array by identity, and `patient-safety-plan.tsx` reads the
   same array by id — neither hand-types a number, so neither needs a matching edit. The
   after-hours entries in `syntheticCmhtContacts` (`fixtures.ts`) still repeat the three WA
   numbers as plain strings and must be corrected separately — they are listed per number in the
   table above.
4. Update `verifiedOn` for every entry checked, and update the matching assertion in
   `tests/care-plan-domain.test.ts:414` (and, for the year-2026-09-25 cohort, the corresponding
   check in `tests/crisis-contacts.test.ts`), which pin the exact date.
5. Update the "Last verified" and "Next due" rows in this document, and record who checked.
6. Run `npx vitest run tests/care-plan-domain.test.ts`.

### Verification history

| Date       | Checked by                                                         | What was checked                                         | Outcome                                                                     |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2026-08-20 | Recorded in the fixture; the person is not named in the repository | All four numbers, against the source URLs above          | Recorded as verified; the evidence is the `verifiedOn` field itself         |
| 2026-09-04 | This document                                                      | Nothing. The record was written from the repository only | **Not a verification.** No network access; no number was checked or changed |

## The fictional numbers printed alongside them

Recorded here because they also print on a patient-facing sheet, and a reader deserves to know which
numbers on it connect to nobody.

The synthetic duty lines `0491 570 101`, `0491 570 111` and `0491 570 121`
(`fixtures.ts:194`, `:211`, `:228`), and the personal-support numbers `0491 570 131`, `0491 570 132`
and `0491 570 141` (`:781`, `:782`, `:814`), are inside the block
`0491 570 006`–`0491 570 156` that this repository treats as reserved for fiction
(`docs/care-plan/sdd-ledger.md:613`). `tests/care-plan-domain.test.ts:444` enforces that numerically
for every number in the main fixture bundle, and `src/components/care-plan/mockups/types.ts:234-236`
carries an `isRealContact` flag so a printed sheet can say which is which.

**Unverified:** `docs/care-plan/cloud-session.md:258-259` records that the implementer did **not**
verify where the reserved block ends. The `156` upper bound is this repository's own working
assumption. To verify against the ACMA determination — no network access in this session.

## Adjacent observation — not part of this record, and nothing was changed

Recorded because it concerns numbers printed on a patient-facing sheet and would otherwise be lost.

`src/components/care-plan/mockups/patient-plan-fixtures.ts` — the resources printed on a person's
**own copy** of their plan — contains invented contact numbers at `0491 570 210`, `220`, `230`,
`240`, `250`, `260` and `270` (lines `236`, `246`, `257`, `267`, `299`, `310`, `353`). These sit
**above** the `0491 570 156` upper bound of the block this repository treats as reserved for
fiction. That is the same defect `docs/care-plan/sdd-ledger.md:623-627` records finding and fixing
in `fixtures.ts` — the ruling notes those numbers "sit above the reserved span and are ordinary
allocatable numbers" and that "these print onto a patient-facing safety plan".

The numeric range assertion that catches this (`tests/care-plan-domain.test.ts:444`) runs over
`serialisedFixtures`, which is built from `fixtures.ts` only
(`tests/care-plan-domain.test.ts:49-76`); `patient-plan-fixtures.ts` is not in that bundle, so the
guard does not see these numbers.

**Nothing here was acted on.** Changing a number is outside the scope of this record, and whether
these are in fact allocatable is exactly the question `cloud-session.md` says nobody has verified.
This paragraph is a pointer for whoever picks it up.

## Claims in this document that could not be verified from the repository

1. **That the four numbers are still correct today.** To verify — no network access in this session.
2. **That the stated availability windows are still correct.** Same reason.
3. **Who performed the 2026-08-20 verification.** The repository records the date, not the person.
4. **The six-month re-verification cadence.** Now established as canonical across the repository,
   reconciling and superseding the 2026-09-02 audit finding L4 (which had proposed 12 months).
5. **Where the ACMA fiction block actually ends.** `cloud-session.md:258-259` records that this was
   never checked.
