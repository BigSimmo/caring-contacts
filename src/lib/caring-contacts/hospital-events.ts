// src/lib/caring-contacts/hospital-events.ts
//
// Hospital status events applied to a caring-contact plan.
//
// Clinical contract (decision lock, 2026-08-19):
//   * a recorded death cancels the plan and every contact that has not gone out, and nothing
//     afterwards may move that plan — not a readmission, not a correction, not a pause request;
//   * a correction to a recorded death raises an incident for human review; it never resumes the
//     episode, because resuming would put messages back in flight off the back of a data fix;
//   * a readmission and a changed mobile number pause the plan; neither rebases the calendar and
//     neither resumes on its own;
//   * a third party may stop the messages temporarily, but may never end a service the patient
//     chose — the withdrawal path refuses them by name;
//   * every refusal is a named reason. Nothing here throws, and nothing fails silently.
//
// This module composes the plan lifecycle in `./model`; it does not reimplement it.
// Pure and deterministic: the same input always yields byte-identical output.
