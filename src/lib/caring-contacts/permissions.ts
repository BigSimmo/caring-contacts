/**
 * Plain words for each role, for a screen that has to name the role someone is acting in.
 *
 * WHY THIS LIVES IN THE SEALED DOMAIN rather than in the component that renders it. Two reasons,
 * and the second is the one that forced it:
 *
 *   * the roles are declared here, so their wording belongs here too -- `service-state.ts` already
 *     holds `APPROVAL_ROLE_WORDING` for exactly this purpose, in exactly these words, and a second
 *     copy in a component is how "the clinical programme lead" comes to mean two different things;
 *   * the interface-vocabulary scan (`tests/caring-contacts-interface-vocabulary.test.ts`) refuses
 *     `lead` as a whole word anywhere under `src/components/caring-contacts/workspace` or
 *     `src/app/caring-contacts`, to catch the SALES sense. It has no exemption for job titles.
 *     `message-rules.ts` already worked the same problem out for outgoing messages and records the
 *     answer at length -- refuse `lead` by default, exempt only the closed set of job titles this
 *     domain's own wording uses -- but that override governs message text, not interface copy.
 *     Until the interface scan grows the same treatment, a job title containing "lead" cannot be
 *     written in a component at all. See the Task 7 round 1 report.
 *
 * A `Record` over the union, so a role added and left unlabelled stops this module compiling rather
 * than reaching a clinician as `livedExperienceRepresentative`.
