// src/lib/caring-contacts/service-state.ts
//
// The service-wide safety stop: one control that halts ALL caring-contact sending, across every
// patient and every team, the moment a confirmed wrong-recipient message, duplicate send,
// unauthorised content, material privacy or security incident, or loss of audit integrity is
// found (spec §4.2).
//
// Two properties this module exists to guarantee, and neither is recoverable elsewhere:
//
//   1. The stop holds. A stop is a service-wide fact, not a per-patient one, and the FIRST record
//      of it is permanent -- a second stop is refused rather than allowed to overwrite the reason,
//      the actor, or the time the first responder recorded. `serviceStopBlocksDispatch` is the
//      single question every dispatch path must ask, and it is true for exactly as long as the
//      service is stopped.
//
//   2. The restart cannot be a single person's decision. Restarting requires recorded approval
//      from all three of the incident lead, the privacy/security owner, and the clinical
//      programme lead -- three ROLES held by three DIFFERENT people. One actor cannot supply a
//      second approval by changing which role they are wearing, and the service does not restart
//      until the approval that completes the third distinct role arrives. There is deliberately
//      no other route back to running: no force flag, no override, no single-actor path.
//
// This is a pure transition module. It reads no ambient time (the caller injects a `Clock`),
// touches no storage, and performs no permission check -- the caller has already asked
// `canPerformCaringContactAction`. Recording the transition in the audit trail is likewise the
// caller's job; see ./audit.

 *
 * Restart approvals are deliberately service-wide: the three seats need not sit in the team that
 * reported the incident, and the first two approvals leave the service stopped. So a store method
 * returning the whole record handed a cross-team approver the reporting team's incident note — and
 * because every store persists a write's return value as its idempotency replay result, that note
 * then sat at rest in a row scoped by row-level security to the APPROVING team, which the API
 * boundary's own narrowing could not reach. Narrowing the return type removes it from the reply and
 * from storage at once, and keeps a replay truthful: the original answer never contained it either.
 *
 * What survives is what an approval is for — the stop still standing, what kind of failure it was,
 * when it was raised, and the approvals recorded so far, the approver's own among them.
