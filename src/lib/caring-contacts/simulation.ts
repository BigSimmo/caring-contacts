// src/lib/caring-contacts/simulation.ts
//
// A deterministic twelve-month driver over the caring-contact domain.
//
// This module holds NO rules. Every decision that matters -- who may write what, whether a contact
// may still go out, what a death does, whether a plan may move -- is made by ./permissions,
// ./model, ./hospital-events, ./schedule and the store. The driver's whole job is to walk a
// timeline, ask, and record the answer. Where it appears to decide something, it is reading a
// value that another module owns:
//
//   * what may be sent          -> the store's `listSendableContacts`, which keys off the owning
//                                  plan's state and then the contact's, and never off `sendAt`. A
//                                  suppressed contact is stored terminal, so it cannot appear there
//                                  at all; since #PAMATF a held plan's contacts cannot either, so a
//                                  paused plan refuses at this step rather than at the dispatch
//                                  write a beat later;
//   * whether a send is on time -> `isWithinApprovedSendWindow` from ./schedule, plus the
//                                  contact's own calendar day, so a retry can never roll into a
//                                  later day and be sent late;
//   * whether a send may happen -> the store refuses; the driver does not pre-empt it.
//
// The retry policy used to be a required caller input, because no module owned one. It now has a
// governed home in ./service-rules, so `retryPolicy` is OPTIONAL and defaults to
// DEFAULT_CONTACT_RETRY_POLICY. The driver still invents nothing -- it reads a value another
// module owns, which is the same discipline, with the value somewhere a service owner can find it.
//
// Determinism: the only clock is the simulated one below, and the only source of provider
// behaviour is the caller's `transport`. The same input always produces the same report.
