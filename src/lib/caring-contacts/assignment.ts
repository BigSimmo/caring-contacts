//
// Plan ownership, reassignment, and coverage (spec §4.2, §4.3). `claimPlan` and `reassignPlan`
// are granted action names with no field to record them against, which is why the workload
// monitor ("active plans per coordinator") is currently uncomputable -- this module is that
// field and its transitions.
//
// Coverage windows are AWST calendar days in YYYY-MM-DD form, matching `PlannedContact.calendarDay`
// (see ./schedule) -- not full ISO instants. `effectiveResponder` compares calendar days for
// exactly that reason: a coordinator names "covering from the 20th to the 27th", not an instant.
//
// A reassignment never deletes the previous owner -- it is appended to `reassignmentHistory`, so
// spec §4.3's "named coordinator and any formal reassignment still visible" stays true. Coverage
// never touches `ownerId` at all: the named coordinator stays visible behind whoever is covering,
// and ends automatically once `atIso`'s calendar day moves past the window.
//
// Pure transition module: no ambient time beyond the injected `Clock`, no storage, no permission
// check -- the caller has already authorised the action.

 * Applies one ownership/coverage action.

 * Refusals:
 *   * `plan-already-claimed` -- `claim` is only legal while there is no owner.
 *   * `plan-not-claimed` -- `reassign` and `startCoverage` both require an existing owner; there
 *     is nobody to reassign from or cover for otherwise.
 *   * `reassignment-reason-required` -- `reassign` requires a non-blank reason.
 *   * `reassignment-to-current-owner` -- `reassign` must name somebody other than the current
 *     owner. A move to oneself would append a handover row saying the plan changed hands when it
 *     did not, indistinguishable afterwards from a real one.
 *   * `coverage-window-not-calendar-day` -- `startCoverage` requires both ends to be real AWST
 *     calendar days in `YYYY-MM-DD` form. Checked BEFORE the ordering, because `until > from` is a
 *     lexical string compare that any pair of words satisfies: `"cherry" > "banana"` is true, so a
 *     window of nonsense used to be accepted and stored, and `effectiveResponder` -- which compares
 *     these as calendar days -- then silently named the wrong person. The Postgres schema's own
 *     `~ '^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$'` check caught the same input by raising, which is a throw where this
 *     domain's convention is a named refusal, and it meant the two stores answered one malformed
 *     request two different ways.
 *   * `coverage-window-invalid` -- `startCoverage` requires `until` strictly after `from`.
 *
 * `reassign` appends to `reassignmentHistory` and keeps the full history -- a reassignment never
 * deletes the earlier owner. `startCoverage` never changes `ownerId`. `endCoverage` always
 * succeeds and clears `coveredBy`.
