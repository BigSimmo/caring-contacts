// src/lib/caring-contacts/in-memory-repository.ts
//
// The in-memory caring-contact store. It is the reference implementation of the contract in
// ./repository.ts, and it is deliberately written so the Postgres store (Task 11) can satisfy the
// identical suite: every guarantee here maps onto one Postgres already has.
//
//   idempotency  -> a unique (team, key) row holding the original result, read inside the same
//                   transaction, so a replay returns the first answer and writes nothing;
//   atomic audit -> the change and its audit row are written in one transaction; if the audit
//                   record cannot be produced or accepted, the transaction never commits;
//   concurrency  -> `UPDATE ... WHERE version = $expected`, which is what the serialised write
//                   queue below reproduces in a single process;
//   team scope   -> a team predicate on every read, matching row-level security.
//
// Composition only: the plan and contact lifecycles live in ./model, hospital events in
// ./hospital-events, the calendar in ./schedule, capability checks in ./permissions, the audit
// record in ./audit, and the episode projection uses ./episode's own `Episode` type. Nothing here
// reimplements any of them.
