// src/lib/caring-contacts-server/handler.ts
//
// The API boundary every caring-contact route goes through, and the reason Phase 1's first open
// item -- "reads are not audited" -- closes here rather than in a store.
//
// A read is only observable where it crosses a boundary. Inside a store, `getPlan` is a map lookup
// that nobody asked for on anybody's behalf; at this seam it is a named actor viewing a named
// object at a known instant, which is exactly what spec 4.2 requires the trail to hold. So
// `recordAccess` lives in `readHandler` and NOWHERE ELSE. A route that could forget the call is
// the failure mode this module exists to remove: routes describe what to read, they never decide
// whether the read is recorded.
//
// Two rules the handlers implement that are easy to lose in a later edit:
//   * an access event is recorded on EVERY read, including a denied one (`outcome: "denied"`), and
//     a read whose event could not be recorded releases nothing at all -- the same bargain the
//     store already makes for writes, where a change whose audit record cannot be produced does
//     not happen either;
//   * a refusal body is always `{ refusal: string }` and never carries patient data. The refusal
//     name is a machine-readable reason from the domain, never a message assembled from a record.
//
// Neither handler re-derives a rule the sealed domain owns. `writeHandler` asks
// `canPerformCaringContactAction` for the capability decision and the store for everything else;
// it never decides for itself what a role may do.
