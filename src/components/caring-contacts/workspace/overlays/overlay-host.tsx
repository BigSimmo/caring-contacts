 * an overlay id anywhere in this file — every branch below is a branch on a
 * MODALITY, of which there are four, and the branch a given overlay takes is
 * read off the table at render time. That is what makes the twenty-four rows
 * data rather than code, and it is what lets Task 19 prove all of them in a
 * browser against the same table this file reads.
 *
 * This is a Client Component, and deliberately the smallest one that can be. The
 * shell's service-wide safety-stop record must never reach here: its incident
 * note is free text a responder typed mid-incident, and a client boundary
 * serialises its props into the payload the browser can read. `blockReason` is a
 * NAMED refusal string, not that record and not any part of it, precisely so this
 * boundary can exist at all. The allowlist and its three conditions are in
 * `tests/caring-contacts-explained-automation.dom.test.tsx` (Ruling 59), and that
 * guard reads this file's source text — which is why the record's own module and
 * type names are described here rather than written.

   * nothing is a control advertising an action the system does not perform. Making this a required
   * prop means a caller that has not answered the question does not compile.
   *
   * The SCOPE is Ruling 90, and it is the half that took a correction. The 24 rows are not one kind
   * of thing: eight carry `mutatesState: false` and their controls are exits rather than
   * confirmations — "Sign in again", "Back to personalisation", "Close this detail". A refusal
   * meaning "nothing can be recorded here" is not a statement that can be made about a control whose
   * whole action is to leave, so it carries `recording-rows-only` and is withheld from those rows.
   * A refusal a screen stated itself carries `every-row`: it meant this row, whatever the row does.
   *
   * Two things separate it from `blockReason` above, and neither is stylistic:
   *
   *  - Its `reason` is a SENTENCE, already in plain words, not a named key. Ruling 61's wording map
   *    exists because `blockReason` is an identifier a screen must not be allowed to invent copy
   *    from; this value IS the copy, written where it is passed, so there is nothing to map.
   *  - It can reach a read-only row, where `blockReason` deliberately cannot. A permission refusal
   *    leaves a read-only overlay usable because there is nothing to permit; a decision a screen has
   *    declared unbuilt is unbuilt whatever the row does.
   *
   * Never the safety-stop record, or any part of it — the same boundary the prop above states.

      It reports the modality the FROZEN CONTRACT chose for this row at this
      width — `widthStateFor(viewportWidth) === "compact" ? phoneModality :
      desktopModality`. That is the authoritative statement of the contract, and
      it matches rendered geometry below 640px and at 768px and above.

      Between 640 and 767 it does not, and cannot: `widthStateFor` switches
      compact→rail at 768, while the shared `Sheet` switches its mobile geometry
      to a centred dialog at Tailwind `sm:` = 640, entirely in CSS with no prop
      to override it. So a `bottom-sheet` row in that band stamps
      `bottom-sheet` and renders as a dialog. `full-screen-stage` rows are
      unaffected — `mobilePlacement="fullscreen"` transitions at `lg:` (1024),
      so they stay fullscreen right across the band.

      Ruling 60 leaves that divergence in place rather than fighting it:
      `sheet.tsx` is a design-system component the whole application uses,
      `widthStateFor` is frozen design non-regression, and a className override
      forcing bottom geometry to 768 would fight the shared component's own
      cascade and break silently the next time it changed. Nothing in the
      24-overlay contract's SAFETY properties — dismissal, fresh authentication,
      blocking — depends on geometry, and the frozen mapping never samples
      431–767 (its review widths are 320/390/430, then 768, 1024, 1440).

      The band is pinned by "the stamped modality and the Sheet's own geometry
      breakpoint disagree only between 640 and 767" in
      `tests/caring-contacts-overlay-host.dom.test.tsx`, so it cannot widen
      unnoticed. Whether the two breakpoints should be reconciled at all is a
      design-record question for the owner, not a fix.
