/**
 * The frozen 24-overlay contract for the production caring-contacts workspace.

 * which is the frozen record. It is deliberately NOT an import from the
 * design-scratch specimen tree — production may never import from it, and
 * `tests/caring-contact-route-files.test.ts` fails on the mere mention of that
 * path here. A hand copy that drifts is worse than no copy at all, so
 * `tests/caring-contacts-overlay-definitions.test.ts` parses the matrix document
 * itself and checks this table against it row for row.
 *
 * Task 18 builds one renderer against these values and Task 19 proves all 24 in
 * a browser at two widths. Change a modality here and you have changed what both
 * of those prove; change it in the matrix document without changing it here and
 * the test goes red naming the row.
 *
 * Every `summary` and `decision` is patient-adjacent interface copy: plain
 * Australian English, sentence case, no clinical inference, and no claim that
 * anybody is reading replies.

 *
 * RULING [130]: NO WIDENING ANNOTATION, AND `as const` BEFORE THE `satisfies`.
 *
 * This declaration used to read `: readonly WorkspaceOverlayDefinition[] =`, and
 * that annotation erased every literal in the table. `id` is declared `string` on
 * `WorkspaceOverlayDefinition` — it has to be, because the type describes the SHAPE
 * of a row rather than the twenty-four rows themselves — so an annotated array
 * carried no more type information than "some overlay definitions", and
 * `overlayId` on a trigger could only ever be a `string`. A mistyped id was then a
 * RUNTIME throw and nothing more, which is how Task 10 came to close the same hole
 * with one, and to record that the type should be carrying it.
 *
 * `as const` is what preserves the literals (`satisfies` alone cannot: it checks
 * against `WorkspaceOverlayDefinition`, whose `id` is already `string`, so there is
 * no narrower expected type for it to keep). The `satisfies` clause after it still
 * does its original job — a row that breaks the shape is a compile error here
 * rather than at the first reader — and now does it without widening anything.
 *
 * What that buys, in one sentence: {@link WorkspaceOverlayId} below is derived from
 * these rows, so a trigger for an id no row carries does not compile.
