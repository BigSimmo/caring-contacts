 * The safeguard wording, repeated verbatim from the frozen prototype baseline.

 * It is redeclared here rather than imported: production may never import from
 * the frozen prototype tree, and `tests/caring-contact-route-files.test.ts`
 * holds that separation in both directions — including against a mere mention
 * of the prototype's path, which is why this comment names it in words only.
 *
 * The exact text is pinned by `tests/caring-contacts-workspace-shell.dom.test.tsx`,
 * on both sides of the workspace, the same way the prototype's copy is pinned by
 * `tests/caring-contact-product-redesign.dom.test.tsx`. Presence alone is not
 * enough: the wording could otherwise be changed to something that no longer
 * says the data is invented, and every gate would still pass.

 * it is.

 * `data-synthetic-marker` is a styling and safeguard hook, deliberately separate
