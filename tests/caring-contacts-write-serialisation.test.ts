/**
 * The one concurrency property in the Postgres store that nothing else can fail on.
 *
 * `ensureTeam` is an unconditional `insert ... on conflict do nothing`, and it is the first
 * statement inside every write transaction. Two same-team writers therefore contend on the teams
 * primary key and queue there, never overlapping anywhere later in the write path -- which is why
 * the one race the database suite proves is only reachable ACROSS teams. Nothing designed that; it
 * falls out of the key, and the source comment at `ensureTeam` says so itself.
 *
 * A comment is not a guard. Making the insert conditional -- an "only if absent" read first, a
 * process cache, a one-time bootstrap -- or moving it after another statement widens the
 * concurrency surface of every write in this store at once, and no behavioural test in the suite
 * would go red: the serialisation it removes is only observable under real contention, which is
 * exactly what a test suite does not reliably produce.
 *
 * So this is a source-text assertion, the same instrument
 * `tests/caring-contacts-explained-automation.dom.test.tsx` and
 * `tests/caring-contact-route-files.test.ts` already use. It is test-only and blocks nothing: it
 * cannot stop the change being made, only stop it being made SILENTLY.
